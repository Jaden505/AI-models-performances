# AI-models-performances

In this project I tried out multiple AI models like decision tree, naive bayes, k-nearest neighbour and random forest. 

The models are each trained on a dataset of bank desposits. And whether or not someone will make a deposit.

The final result shows 2 charts, displaying how each model scored in a bar chart and a AOC (Area under curve) chart.
